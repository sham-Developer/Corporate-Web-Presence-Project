        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <hr></hr>
        <h4>What is Front end?</h4>
        <p>
Front-end refers to the part of a software application or website that users interact with directly. It encompasses the visual elements and user interface, including design, layout, and interactivity. Front-end development involves creating and optimizing the user experience using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, often with the help of frameworks and libraries. It ensures that the digital product is user-friendly, responsive across different devices, and visually appealing to engage and serve the needs of the end user.

        <h4>What is Backend ?</h4>
        <p>
           
Backend is the behind-the-scenes component of a software application that handles data processing, server-side logic, and database management. It's responsible for storing and retrieving data, managing user accounts, and performing various tasks that enable the functionality of the front-end. Backend development often uses server-side languages and technologies to ensure data security, scalability, and the smooth operation of the entire system. While users don't directly interact with the backend, it's a crucial part of any digital service, working in tandem with the front-end to deliver a complete and functional user experience.

        <h4>What is Server?</h4>
        <p>
        A server is a specialized computer or software system designed to provide services, data, or resources to other computers, known as clients, over a network. Servers can serve various purposes, such as hosting websites, managing email communications, storing and retrieving data, and running applications. They are optimized for reliability, high availability, and performance, ensuring that clients can access the resources or services they need efficiently. Servers are a fundamental component of the internet and networked computing, facilitating the exchange of information and enabling various online services to function. 
        </p>
        <h4>What is cloud computing?</h4>
        <p>
            
Cloud computing is a technology that enables users to access and utilize computing resources, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more, over the internet. Instead of maintaining and managing physical infrastructure, individuals and organizations can rely on cloud service providers to deliver these resources on a pay-as-you-go basis. Cloud computing offers scalability, flexibility, cost-efficiency, and the ability to access data and applications from anywhere with an internet connection. It has become a fundamental technology for businesses and individuals, powering a wide range of online services, from web hosting and data storage to software development and machine learning.
        </p>
        <h4>Different between mobile applications and web applications</h4>
        <p>
        Mobile applications and web applications serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Mobile applications are designed to run on specific mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, and are typically downloaded and installed from app stores. They can offer offline functionality after installation. Web applications, on the other hand, run within web browsers and are accessed through URLs. They work on various devices with web browsers and an internet connection but don't require installation. Mobile apps often have a more tailored and optimized user experience, making use of the device's features, whereas web apps are more versatile but may not offer the same level of performance and offline functionality. The choice between the two depends on factors like target audience, functionality, and the user experience you want to provide. Many businesses and developers opt for a combination of both to reach a broader audience.
